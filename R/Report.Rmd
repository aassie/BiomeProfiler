# Overview of your project

## General stat from metadata

You have submitted a metadata with `r ncol(M)-1` categories and you choosed to run stats on `r selecteur1`

The following sample are in the metadata but not in the dataset:
`r Missing.sample.1`

The following sample are in the dataset but not in the metadata:
`r Missing.sample.2`

## Count quality

The following were below the count threshold of `r count.threshold` reads: `r Sample.filteredout.read` and have been removed.

## The genomes

For you experiment you used a collection of `XGENOME`. 

From those genomes, the pipeline found `r length(Genome.present)` genomes mapping to ASV present in your dataset. 

`r length(Genome.absent)` are not present in the database yet. 
Those are: `r Genome.absent`

=====

The following ASV sequences have no count:
`r null.row`

The following samples are empty:
`r null.col`

Both empty ASV and Sample were removed from the rest of the analysis.

# Oveview of the ASV table

The ASV not mapping to any selected genomes represent `r sum(SubRS[,2])`% of the dataset.


```{R}
setwd(PWD)
Figure1<-ggpubr::ggarrange(ASV.barplot,ASV.PCoa, labels=c("A","B"))
ggsave(filename = paste(out.folder, "Figure1.png", sep=""),plot = Figure1, device = "png",width = 20, height = 10, dpi=72)
knitr::include_graphics(paste(out.folder, "Figure1.png",sep=""), dpi = 72)
```

# ASV matched to Genome

The available genome in the database represents `r MeanASV`% of the diversity.

```{R}
setwd(PWD)
knitr::include_graphics(paste(out.folder, "ASV.genome.png",sep=""), dpi = 72)
```
# Metabolic prediction based on Metacyc reconstruction
```{R}
setwd(PWD)
knitr::include_graphics(paste(out.folder, "Metacyc.pcoa.png",sep=""), dpi = 72)
```


# Functional prediction based on KEGG annotations
```{R}
setwd(PWD)
knitr::include_graphics(paste(out.folder, "Kegg.pcoa.png",sep=""), dpi = 72)
```
